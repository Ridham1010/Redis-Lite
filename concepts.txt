1.TCP/IP and socket programming - TCP/IP → the rules/protocols for communication.
                                Sockets → the programming interface that lets us use TCP/IP in code.
2.Concurrency and Multithreading -Concurrency means doing multiple tasks at the same time.
3.Mutex and syncronization- to prevent inconsistance in the results when multiplethreads share same
                            resources.
4.Data structures-Hash tables and vectors
5.Parsing and RESP protocol-RESP-Redis serialization protocol -Protocol that Redis uses to encode commands and responses.
                            that means client send this commands to server to perform tasks
                            for example you want Redis to store a key-value pair: SET name Shrey
                            RESP -
                            *3\r\n
                            $3\r\nSET\r\n
                            $4\r\nname\r\n
                            $5\r\nShrey\r\n
                             
                            +------+---------+
                            | Key  | Value   |
                            +------+---------+
                            | name | Shrey   |

8.Command process and response Formatting-Client               Server
                                            |                    |
                                            | Send RESP command  |

                                            |   Parse command    |
                                            |   Execute operation|

                                            |   Format response  |
                                            |<------------------|
